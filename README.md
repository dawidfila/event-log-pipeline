# Log Analytics Pipeline

## Project Overview

data engineering pipeline that simulates real-world log analytics using MongoDB, Apache Airflow, and Python. This project demonstrates a complete ETL workflow following industry best practices, from data generation through transformation to visualization and automated orchestration.
The pipeline processes synthetic application logs (user activities, events, errors) and transforms them into actionable insights through aggregations and visualizations, mimicking real-world scenarios such as user behavior tracking, performance monitoring, or sales analytics.
